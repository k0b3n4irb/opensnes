# OpenSNES Roadmap

Current state of the project and planned work. The single source of truth for
known traps and trade-offs is [`KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md);
the design principles every roadmap item must respect live in
[`PHILOSOPHY.md`](PHILOSOPHY.md). This file tracks **what is shipped**
and **what is next**.

---

## Current Status: post-v0.36.1

A modern, well-tested SNES SDK ready for serious hobby development, game jams,
and educational use, building toward commercial-grade maturity. The compiler
produces code 30 % faster than PVSnesLib + 816-opt on the benchmark suite. 84
working examples cover every major subsystem, with cross-platform CI on Linux,
macOS, and Windows enforcing not just "it compiles" but the full functional
test suite (luna, cycle-accurate native — corpus liveness + visual
regression + functional probes; SA-1/Super FX/DSP-1 run natively). Run
`make tests`, or `python3 tools/luna-test/luna_runner.py --list` for the corpus —
the suite grows
with new chantiers and a single hard-coded number rots fast.

### Audience

OpenSNES targets developers with prior 65816 / SNES / PVSnesLib experience.
The hardware traps (VRAM only during VBlank, 4 KB DMA budget per frame, bank
$00 ROM overflow, push-order inversion vs PVSnesLib, etc.) are documented
honestly in [`KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md) — read it before
starting a project. Newcomers to SNES development should ramp up on the
hardware via the tutorials before adopting the SDK in earnest.

## Recently shipped (post-v0.13.0 maintenance work)

This stretch focused on closing process gaps surfaced by an internal audit
(P0/P1/P2/P3/P4 remediation plan). Highlights:

### Build & process safety
- **Bank $00 ROM overflow check** runs on every link (`make/common.mk`).
  String-literal spills now fail the build with a fix-it message instead of
  producing garbage at runtime.
- **`make verify-toolchain`** compares `compiler/{cproc,qbe,wla-dx}` HEADs
  against [`compiler/PINS.md`](compiler/PINS.md). CI runs the same check
  before every build — `git submodule update --remote` can no longer drift
  the toolchain past tested commits.
- **clang `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` syntax check** runs in parallel with
  `cc65816` for every C source. The SDK is currently warning-clean and stays
  that way (caught two real bugs in `lib/source/hdma.c` and tetris).
- **Tag-on-main guard** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): a tag whose commit
  isn't on `main` fails fast instead of producing a release ZIP.
- **Commit-message lint** (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`): rejects PRs whose
  commits violate Conventional Commits or sneak in a `Co-Authored-By:`
  trailer.

### Architecture & docs
- `lib/source/object.asm` (3 124 LOC game-engine) relocated to `lib/contrib/`
  — `lib/source/` now only contains hardware-wrapping modules.
- `compiler/ABI.md`: empirically verified calling-convention reference
  (push order, frame layout, return values, type sizes, calling C from ASM
  and vice versa).
- `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`: 14-entry severity-tagged catalog of silent
  failures inherited from the 65816 / SNES architecture and the toolchain.
- `tools/luna-test/`: luna-driven test harness — visual baselines keyed on
  luna's cross-arch-stable `--print-fbhash`, regenerated with
  `luna_runner.py --update`.

### Test suite
- **luna** is the sole automated test backend (cycle-accurate native emulator,
  pinned binary; runs SA-1 / Super FX / DSP-1 natively).
- **CI runs the full luna suite** on Linux (coverage + visual regression +
  functional probes) plus the compiler C→ASM checks and the cycle benchmark.
- **2 new compiler regression guards** (`test_arg_push_order`,
  `test_section_directives`) cover the ABI invariants P2.2 identified.
- Visual baselines now carry provenance metadata (rom hash, snes9x commit,
  capture timestamp). The runner emits `[WARN]` on drift instead of
  silently miscomparing.

## Completed

### Toolchain
- [x] **cc65816** — C11 compiler (cproc + QBE w65816 backend)
- [x] **wla-65816 / wlalink** — Assembler and linker (WLA-DX)
- [x] **wla-spc700** — SPC700 audio assembler
- [x] **gfx4snes** — PNG/BMP to SNES tiles, palettes, tilemaps
- [x] **font2snes** — Font converter
- [x] **smconv** — Impulse Tracker (.it) to SNESMOD soundbank (rewritten in pure C)

### Compiler optimisations
- [x] Dead jump elimination + A-register cache
- [x] 8/16-bit mode tracking + byte immediates
- [x] Leaf and non-leaf function optimisation (param alias, frame elimination)
- [x] Comparison + branch fusion
- [x] `pea.w` for constant args, `.l` → `.w` address shortening
- [x] `stz` for zero stores, redundant `cmp #0` elimination
- [x] Dead store elimination + aggressive frame elimination
- [x] Inline multiply (×3, ×5, ×6, ×7, ×9, ×10, ×11–×15)
- [x] Composite constant multiply (×20, ×24, ×40, ×48, ×96)
- [x] `.ACCU 16` / `.INDEX 16` for WLA-DX register-size tracking
- [x] Variable shift codegen fix (`(1 << variable)`)
- [x] Signed division and modulo (`__sdiv16` / `__smod16`)
- [x] **Tail call optimisation** — shipped (chantiers C.1 / C.2.1 / C.2.2;
      QBE patches `ed840fb` and `bab0164` per `compiler/PINS.md`). The
      `tail_call`, `lazy_rep20`, `plx_cleanup` test cases that previously
      ran under `--allow-known-bugs` were investigated in chantier A3 and
      found to be testing optimisations that had already shipped; the
      markers were stale. CI no longer passes `--allow-known-bugs`.
- [x] **A-cache through `pha`** — shipped; chantier C.6's audit confirmed
      the optimisation already worked, the `acache_pha` test was stale.
      Hard-fails any regression as of chantier A3 (2026-05-09).

## Planned: v1.0

### Must-have

| Item | Status | Why it matters |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Pre-built binary releases | Done (`release.yml`) | Adoption blocker — users shouldn't need to compile the compiler |
| Hardware verification docs | Not started | Credibility — document testing on real SNES via FXPak Pro |
| Showcase game (not a port) | In progress (RPG project) | Proves the SDK can ship a complete game |
| Published performance benchmark | Done (`docs/BENCHMARK.md`) | Shows the 30 % improvement with data |
| Migration guide PVSnesLib → OpenSNES | Not started | Smoothest adoption path for existing PVSnesLib users |
| FAQ | Not started | Reduces support load |
| `examples/maps/dynamic_map` cleanup | **Done (2026-07-12)** | Dead code removed: unused `maputil.c` TU, `getSprite*`/`updateSprite*`/`calculateSprite*` engine paths, `sram*` ASM helpers + 16 KB dead `$7F` RAMSECTION; stale C64-converter claims corrected |

### Nice-to-have

| Item | Status | Why it matters |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Pixel mode (Mode 3 direct drawing) | Not started | Feature parity with PVSnesLib (niche) |
| Tiled map editor integration | Not started | Workflow convenience for level designers |
| Video tutorials | Not started | Wider audience reach |
| Project scaffolding (`opensnes init`) | **Shipped (v0.25.0)** — `opensnes` CLI: init/build/run/doctor | Reduce friction for new users |

### Next steps (audit-driven, prioritised)

- [ ] **Sprite/text duplication audit** (P3.2) — `lib/source/` has parallel
      C and ASM implementations of `sprite` and `text`. Benchmark each,
      decide migration vs documentation, eliminate duplications. Largest
      remaining cleanup item (2–3 weeks, perf-critical so risk is real).
- [x] **SuperFX / SA-1 functional tests** (P3.4) — *(SUPERSEDED 2026-06-20: luna runs SA-1 / Super FX natively in the headless harness; the Mesen2 phase and the `opensnes-emu` submodule were removed. See `.claude/notes/chantiers/luna_migration.md`.)* Originally added a Mesen2-headless
      visual regression phase
      (`tools/opensnes-emu/test/phases/visual-mesen2.mjs`) running the
      vendored Mesen2 binary in `--testrunner` mode against the four
      chip-using examples. snes9x's libretro core does not detect the
      GSU chip in OpenSNES' SuperFX ROM headers, so the snes9x-based
      visual phase only validates "boots without crashing" for chip
      ROMs; Mesen2 actually executes the chip code and gives a
      meaningful baseline. The phase auto-skips when the binary is
      absent (`scripts/install-mesen2.sh` fetches it once per CI run,
      cached locally). 4 new checks, total 257 → 261. Done in
      ~1 day rather than the originally estimated 2 weeks.
- [x] **Retire residual TCO `[KNOWN_BUG]` test cases** — done in
      chantier A3 (2026-05-09). Investigation showed every optimisation
      the markers gated had already shipped; the test assertions had
      drifted away from current emit-pass behaviour rather than
      anticipating future work. Markers removed, assertions converted
      to hard-fail, `--allow-known-bugs` dropped from CI.
- [ ] **Mode 7 game example** (racing or flying)
- [ ] **Streaming audio support**
- [ ] **Hardware verification documentation**
- [ ] **Original-game release**
- [ ] **Video tutorial series**

## Known limitations

The full catalog with severity tags lives in
[`KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md). Headlines:

- **No floating-point** — use fixed-point math (`<snes/math.h>`)
- **`int` is 2 bytes, `long` is 4 bytes** on this target (since chantier
  A1, 2026-05-08) — bare `int` is now correct, but `u16` / `s16` /
  `u32` from `<snes/types.h>` remain preferred for portability
- **~4 KB VBlank DMA budget** per frame
- **All C variables must be in bank $00, < $2000** — compiler emits
  `sta.l $0000,x`
- **Push order is LEFT-TO-RIGHT** (vs PVSnesLib's right-to-left) — see
  [`compiler/ABI.md`](compiler/ABI.md) before porting an ASM helper
