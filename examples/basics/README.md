# Basics Examples

Game mechanics that go beyond graphics and audio: collision detection, smooth movement,
and interactive UI. These examples combine input, sprites, and math into patterns you'll
reuse in every game.

| Example | What you'll learn |
|---------|------------------|
| [Calculator](calculator/) | Edge detection input, cursor UI, integer math on a CPU with no divide |
| [Collision Demo](collision_demo/) | Bounding-box collision between sprites |
| [Smooth Movement](smooth_movement/) | Sub-pixel positioning with fixed-point arithmetic |
