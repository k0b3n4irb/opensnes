# Input & peripherals

**Family 4 — "can the player act?"** This is the rung that turns a demo into a
game. Read the pad, move something with it, then branch out to the SNES's
exotic controllers. The console auto-reads every input device each VBlank; you
just read the result.

## The ladder

| Rung | Example | Developer question |
|------|---------|--------------------|
| 4.1 | [controller](controller/) | How do I read a joypad — held vs just-pressed? |
| 4.2 | [two_players](two_players/) | How do I read two players independently? |
| 4.3 | [mouse](mouse/) | How do I read the SNES Mouse? |
| 4.4 | [superscope](superscope/) | How do I read the Super Scope light gun? |

Driving a sprite with the pad is the `starter/` project at the SDK root —
the same program, with the asset pipeline of 1.x.

## The idea in one screen

`padHeld(0)` returns a 16-bit bitmask of the buttons held this frame;
`padPressed(0)` returns only those *newly* pressed (edge detection — without
it, a single tap registers dozens of times at 60 Hz). Act on the bits, and for
movement push the result to a sprite with `oamSetXY`.

```
Bit: 15  14  13   12   11  10  9   8   7  6  5  4
     B   Y   Sel  Sta  Up  Dn  Lt  Rt  A  X  L  R
```

The **mouse** and **Super Scope** are read the same way after a device-ID
check; the Super Scope lives on port 2 and latches its aim from the PPU's H/V
counters.

> Start at 4.1 to read the pad, then 4.2 to feel a sprite respond to it —
> that's the moment it becomes a game.
