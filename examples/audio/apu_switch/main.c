/**
 * @file main.c
 * @brief Hot-swapping APU programs at runtime — apuReset() in action
 * @ingroup examples
 *
 * The apu module's upload path (apuWaitBoot/apuUpload/apuExecute) runs
 * once, at boot. This example adds the missing capability: replacing
 * the running APU program at ANY time. The method is krom (Peter
 * Lemon)'s PlayTwoSong protocol, productized: the 65816 writes
 * APU_RESET_MAGIC to I/O port 0 (apuReset()); the SPC700 program polls
 * for it in its wait loops (the APU_CHECK_RESET idiom), silences the
 * DSP, and jumps back to the IPL boot ROM — ready for the next upload.
 *
 * Press A for the play_noise drum kit, B for the pitch_mod vibrato
 * cello. Both APU programs are this repo's own — no external assets
 * beyond the cello sample already attributed.
 *
 * ROM mode: LoROM (project default).
 *
 * @par SNES Concepts
 * - Cooperative APU reset: CPU→APU messaging over $2140 after boot
 * - The IPL ROM is re-entrant — jump to $FFC0 with the ROM re-enabled
 *   and the full boot handshake ($AA/$BB, $CC upload) works again
 * - Two independent APU programs in one ROM, uploaded on demand
 *
 * @par What to Observe
 * Drums start immediately. Press B: the kit cuts, the cello blooms.
 * Press A: back to the drums. The backdrop tracks the active program
 * (red = drums, amber = cello). Swap latency is a few frames — the
 * SPC polls for the reset request every millisecond.
 *
 * @par Modules Used
 * console, apu, input
 *
 * @see https://github.com/PeterLemon/SNES — PlayTwoSong, the original
 *   protocol demo (its songs use samples ripped from commercial games,
 *   so this port swaps between two OpenSNES-native programs instead)
 * @see drums.spc700.asm, cello.spc700.asm — the two APU programs
