/* Codegen pin for opensnes#99 (FIXED): a u8 read-modify-write through a
 * pointer, then re-read.
 *
 * The byte STORE (`sta.l $0000,x`) deliberately leaves A in 8-bit mode
 * (Ostoreb doesn't restore, so consecutive byte stores stay cheap). The
 * following byte LOAD's indirect path must therefore emit `rep #$20`
 * before its 16-bit `lda <addr>,s` address reload — otherwise the reload
 * grabs only the pointer's LOW byte and `tax` keeps a stale high byte, so
 * the re-read hits the wrong page. The bug only surfaced for structs
 * outside page zero (a stack local), which is why lib code masked it.
 *
 * Behavioural pin: r_rmw_u8 in testing/fixtures/libtests. This is the static
 * codegen shape. */
