"""A6 far-pointer MATRIX runtime test (Tier 2, Phase A — A1).

Each cell is a pointer DEREF crossed by {byte, word, long, param/RSlot, phi} ×
{bank $00, bank $02}. Bank-$02 deref cells exercise the A6 far gap (KNOWN_FAIL
until the far-deref codegen lands); bank-$00 cells + the pointer-VALUE high half
must already pass. As Phase A turns a bank-$02 cell green it XPASSes — promote it
out of KNOWN_FAIL. The run fails ONLY on a regression of an expected-green cell,
so it is a safe gate while Phase A is in flight.

Run: cd devtools/compiler-tests/runtime/a6_farptr && make && python3 test_a6_farptr.py

# The A6 gap: far DEREF of bank-$02 data. (hi2 is the pointer value, not a deref.)
# FINDING (A1 baseline): l2_0 — the Kl (u32) load — is ALREADY bank-aware on qbe
# 1884a20 (reads bank $02 correctly) while byte/word/param/phi are not. So the
# long-load emit path is the working model to replicate for the other forms in A2.
#
# TRAP (2026-07-04): b2_0/b2_7/fp2 were briefly promoted out after XPASSing
# locally — the XPASS came from a STALE local a6_farptr.sfc built during the
# A2 cell-#1 byte-load experiment (matrix green, corpus regressed, never
# merged). A clean rebuild on the PINNED toolchain fails them. Before trusting
# an XPASS here, `make clean` this directory first; `make tests` now does.
#
# ph2 promoted out 2026-08-13: `pp = cond ? p2 : p0; ph2 = pp[5]` failed
# because qbe's phi lowering (emitphimoves) dropped the SELECTED pointer's
# bank byte — a phi/conditional yielding a Kl (far) value stored only the low
# 16 bits, so the deref read the wrong bank. Fixed in w65816/emit.c; verified
# fail->pass across a clean rebuild on the unfixed vs fixed compiler (NOT the
# stale-ROM trap above). See .claude/notes/tech/ternary_addr_const_bank_drop.md.
# (b2_0/b2_7/w2_0/w2_2/fp2 remain listed — they XPASS as a separate stale A6
# far-deref-gap closure, out of scope for this fix.)
