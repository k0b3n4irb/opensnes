"""Probe: soundboard — the audio v2 engine driven by pad input.

Asserts on examples/audio/soundboard:
1. boot: play_count == 0 (nothing pressed, engine idle);
2. press A: play_count >= 1 and last_voice == 0 (first round-robin
   voice) — proving audioInit + audioLoadSample x4 + audioPlaySampleEx
   all completed from plain C in a real example ROM.

Single-button script, HELD without release on purpose: with a
release checkpoint the press window can fall inside audioInit's
boot+load phase and be missed entirely (codegen changes shift init
timing — bit us after #121's cst far loads). A held mask produces
exactly one padPressed edge at the first poll, whenever that is —
independent of the exact init timing, which is why it is held rather
than pulsed. (luna#126, the earlier checkpoint re-fire, was fixed in
v1.13.0; the held mask remains the right call for the init-timing
reason above.)
