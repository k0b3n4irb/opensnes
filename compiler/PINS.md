# Compiler Toolchain Pins

This file is the **source of truth** for which commit of each compiler submodule
the OpenSNES SDK is built against. Advancing a submodule pointer requires
updating this file in the same commit. `make verify-toolchain` enforces it,
and CI runs the check before every build.

## Why this exists

The audit (`~/opensnes_audit_2026-04-26.md` §2.1) flagged that the three
compiler submodules float on upstream without rationale:

> Si un commit upstream casse silencieusement la codegen 65816 (déjà arrivé :
> `mktype()` UB, struct init, signed promotion — corrigés *après* avoir cassé
> des ROMs), il n'y a aucun buffer.

A `git submodule update --remote` would silently advance any of them past the
point where the test suite is known to pass. The pin table below names
exactly which commit each submodule must be at for the SDK to be considered
"green". Anyone running `make verify-toolchain` gets a hard failure if drift
is detected.

## Pinned commits

The block between the BEGIN/END markers is parsed by
`devtools/verify_toolchain.py`. Format: `| path | sha | source |`. Do not
reformat without updating the script.

## Local patches carried on top of upstream

These commits exist only on the OpenSNES forks and must survive any sync
with upstream. Listed newest-first.

### compiler/cproc — 14 patches (upstream merge-base: 7051114)

```
1a626e2  qbe: namespace anonymous local-linkage globals per translation unit
e045ccc fix(qbe): int->class mapping and operand widening for a 4-byte `l`
6bdd923  feat(65816): pointer size/align 8/8 → 4/2 (chantier A6.1)
cceac4b  fix(65816): preserve volatile through QBE IR  (chantier A2)
7f26c16  fix(65816): align int/long type sizes with the w65816 target  (chantier A1)
3618c72  fix: eliminate all Clang warnings
ea95cac  fix: initialize all struct type fields in mktype() to prevent UB
801c3e6  fix: add cleanup functions to free maps, arrays, and paramtemps at exit
d15362a  fix(65816): string constification + unsigned promotion detection
03842ce  fix(qbe): pass const-qualified data sections to QBE backend
d929b94  fix(w65816): fix pointer and type handling for QBE IL generation
```

`mktype()` UB (ea95cac) was discovered after a build silently produced a struct
in ROM instead of WRAM — that's the kind of regression a careless submodule
bump would re-introduce.

The chantier-A1 patch (7f26c16) reduces `sizeof(int)` from 4 to 2 and
`sizeof(long)` from 8 to 4. The pointer size deliberately stays at 8 (its
own structural defect is tracked as A6 in the structural-defects catalogue;
reducing pointer storage cascades through QBE w65816's indirect-call emit
pass). Empirically validated against the full quick test suite.

### compiler/qbe — 52 patches (the bulk of the SDK's compiler magic)

Selected highlights (full list via `git -C compiler/qbe log HEAD --not upstream/master --oneline`):

```

```

These commits implement the cycle reductions documented in
`~/.claude/.../memory/compiler_optimizations.md` (Phases 1 through 7a, total
−22% vs PVSnesLib baseline). Lose them and benchmarks regress.

### compiler/wla-dx — 0 patches ahead; pinned to the **v10.7 release**

The submodule HEAD is the `v10.7` release tag (`91c52b1f`), which our
fork mirrors from upstream. Zero local patches.

**Why not the newer master.** upstream master (`4f8bbdce`, `v10.7-9`)
carries a regression: a `SUPERFREE` section that exactly fills a ROM bank
fails to link (`FIX_LABEL_ADDRESSES: cannot map label`). Bisected to
`4c3c042e` (`v10.7-7`, "Added SPAN to .SECTIONs"). The v10.7 **release**
predates it (`v10.7-0`) and is clean — verified by a full corpus build +
suite on 2026-07-25 (74/74 fbhash, 72/72 WRAM, all identical to the
previous `ffe59ca1` pin, so the 90-commit advance is behaviour-neutral).
See `.claude/notes/tech/wla_span_regression.md` and the draft upstream
report. Do not advance past `a369bec5` (`v10.7-6`) until the regression
is fixed upstream.

## Updating a pin

When a real reason exists to bump a submodule (security fix, feature merge,
upstream resync), do this in **one** commit:

```sh
# 1. Move the submodule to the new SHA
cd compiler/qbe
git fetch
git checkout <new-sha>
cd ../..

# 2. Run the full test suite — this is the gate
make tests
# Must end with `ALL CHECKS PASSED (luna)`. Investigate any failure first.

# 3. Update PINS.md: replace the SHA in the table above, document any new
#    local patches in the per-submodule list. Keep the rationale terse.

# 4. Stage both changes and commit together
cd /path/to/opensnes
git add compiler/qbe compiler/PINS.md
git commit -m "chore(submodule): bump qbe to <short-sha> (<reason>)"

# 5. Push and verify CI green. The verify-toolchain step runs before every
#    build — drift between submodule pointer and PINS.md fails the build.
```

## Drift check

```sh
make verify-toolchain
```

Reads the BEGIN/END block above, compares each entry against
`git submodule status`, and exits non-zero if any submodule's HEAD doesn't
match its pinned SHA. CI calls this before `make release` so a stale or
unauthorised submodule pointer can never produce a release artifact.

## Out of scope (intentionally)

- `docs/doxygen-awesome-css` — cosmetic, third-party, low-risk; not pinned.
- **luna** (test backend) — not a submodule; pinned as a downloaded binary via
  `tools/luna-test/luna.version` + `scripts/install-luna.sh` (SHA-256 verified).
