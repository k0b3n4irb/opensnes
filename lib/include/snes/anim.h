/**
 * @file anim.h
 * @brief Declarative animation player — data-driven frame sequencing
 *
 * Replaces the hand-rolled tempo counters every game rewrites (a tick
 * variable, a modulo gate, manual oamframeid/oamrefresh pokes) with two
 * small structs and one explicit per-frame call.
 *
 * A **frame value is an opaque u16** — the player sequences it without
 * interpreting it. Choose what it means per clip:
 *   - an `oamframeid` for the dynamic sprite engine (see animTickOam()),
 *   - an index into a gfx4snes `-T` metasprite pointer table
 *     (see animTickMeta()),
 *   - a raw OAM tile number for oamSetTile().
 *
 * Zero global state, zero init call, zero link dependencies: all state
 * lives in caller-owned AnimPlayer structs, and nothing runs unless you
 * tick. Pausing an animation = not ticking it (costs nothing).
 *
 * @par Layout contract (tooling-facing)
 * AnimClip (12 bytes: two 4-byte far pointers + 4 u8 fields) and
 * AnimPlayer (8 bytes: one far pointer + 4 u8 fields) layouts below are a
 * public contract: editors (Cooper) emit AnimClip as generated C data.
 * Field order, sizes and semantics are stable; `reserved` fields must
 * be 0.
 *
 * @par Cost (per PHILOSOPHY.md P5)
 * animTick() on the non-advancing path is a NULL check, a finished
 * check, a decrement/compare and one indexed u16 load — on the order of
 * 60–90 cycles per player per frame including call overhead. RAM cost is
 * 8 bytes per player; ROM cost 12 bytes per clip + 2 bytes per frame
 * (+1/frame if per-frame durations are used). Nothing runs in NMI; VRAM
 * upload only happens when a frame actually changes (the dynamic
 * engine's existing budget).
 *
 * @note Clips declared with DECLARE_ANIM_CLIP are ROM const data. Since
 * v0.41.0 (#127.3) const data lives in the asset banks and every C read of
 * it is a far read, so a clip works from any bank and costs no bank-$00
 * space. The warning that stood here — "they spill to bank $01+ and are read
 * as garbage; use non-const RAM clips" — described the pre-#121 compiler;
 * following it now only wastes RAM.
 *
 * Requires 'anim' in LIB_MODULES.
