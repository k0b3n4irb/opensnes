 * @brief SNES DMA (Direct Memory Access)
 *
 * Functions for fast memory transfers using DMA.
 *
 * ## DMA Overview
 *
 * DMA allows fast transfers between:
 * - Work RAM ↔ VRAM (video RAM)
 * - Work RAM ↔ CGRAM (palette RAM)
 * - Work RAM ↔ OAM (sprite RAM)
 *
 * DMA is much faster than CPU copying and should be used for
 * all bulk transfers during VBlank.
 *
 * ## VBlank Timing Requirement
 *
 * @warning **CRITICAL**: VRAM, CGRAM, and OAM can only be safely accessed
 * during VBlank (vertical blanking period) or when the screen is in force blank
 * mode (INIDISP bit 7 set). Accessing these memories during active display
 * causes visual corruption and undefined behavior.
 *
 * @warning **VBlank Budget**: You have approximately 2,200 CPU cycles during
 * VBlank for DMA transfers. This translates to roughly **4KB of data** that
 * can be safely transferred per frame. While the theoretical maximum is higher,
 * 4KB is a safe practical limit that accounts for NMI handler overhead.
 *
 * ## Banks
 *
 * @note Every dmaCopy* function takes a **far pointer** and uses its bank
 * byte, so the source may live in any bank — a SUPERFREE section, a bank
 * you pinned yourself, anywhere. This has been true since the A6 chantier
 * made pointer arguments 4 bytes; the *Bank variants remain for the case
 * where an address and its bank are held separately.
 *
 * This header claimed the opposite ("source data must be in bank $00")
 * long after it stopped being true, and that prose is why the RPG
 * template shipped a pointless `semifree bank 0` section for its
 * palettes — and why issue #122 carried a bank-$00 claim about
 * dmaCopyCGram that testing then had to retract.

/**
 * @brief Copy data to VRAM (PVSnesLib compatible)
 *
 * Copies data from ROM or RAM to VRAM using DMA. This function handles
 * 24-bit source addresses, so it works with ROM data defined via extern.
 *
 * @param source Source address (can be ROM or RAM)
 * @param vramAddr Destination word address in VRAM
 * @param size Number of bytes to copy
 *
 * @code
 * extern char tileset[];
 * extern char tileset_end[];
 * WaitForVBlank();
 * dmaCopyVram(tileset, 0x0000, tileset_end - tileset);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @warning Must be called during VBlank or forced blank. During active
 *          display the PPU rejects VRAM writes and the transfer is
 *          silently lost.
 *
 *          Forced blank means setScreenOff() — INIDISP bit 7.
 *          setBrightness(0) blacks the screen but leaves the PPU
 *          fetching, so it does NOT open the write window.
 *
 * @warning **VBlank fits roughly 4 KB.** A larger transfer has its tail
 *          dropped during active display, and the failure is partial:
 *          the first few KB land, so the screen is half right. Anything
 *          bigger than a few KB belongs between setScreenOff() and
 *          setScreenOn(), not in VBlank.
 *
 * @note The bank is taken from @p source's own bank byte, so the data
 *       may live in ANY bank — a SUPERFREE section, a bank you pinned
 *       yourself. dmaCopyVramBank() exists for the case where the
 *       address and the bank are held separately.
