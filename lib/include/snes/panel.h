/**
 * @file panel.h
 * @brief Opt-in 9-slice panels — bordered boxes on a background layer.
 * @ingroup ui
 *
 * Every SNES RPG draws the same thing: a bordered box over the map, with
 * text in it. So does every status bar. Both are a **9-slice panel** —
 * corners, edges and a fill stamped from a 3x3 tile sheet — and both were
 * ~60 lines of stamping loop and priority wiring in each game that wanted
 * one.
 *
 * @par Why it is not called `window`
 * `<snes/window.h>` is the PPU's window/masking registers. This is
 * unrelated furniture.
 *
 * @par The tilemap is yours
 * `panelInit()` takes the 32x32 entry buffer rather than owning one. A
 * panel tilemap is 2 KB and C RAM is an 8 KB band (KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md,
 * defect B2) — a module that allocated it silently would be spending a
 * quarter of a game's RAM without saying so. Declaring it yourself keeps
 * the cost where you can see it, and lets two layers each have one.
 *
 * @par Several panels, one layer, one upload
 * Panels are stamped into that buffer, not uploaded individually. A HUD
 * at the top and a dialog box at the bottom are two `panelDraw()` calls
 * into the same map and a single `panelFlush()`. Opening the dialog is
 * `panelDraw` + `panelFlush`; closing it is `panelClear` + `panelFlush`,
 * and the HUD is untouched either way.
 *
 * @par The upload is forced blank
 * `panelFlush()` pushes 2 KB, which does not fit the ~4 KB VBlank budget
 * alongside anything else, so it wraps the DMA in `setScreenOff()` /
 * `setScreenOn()` — real forced blank, INIDISP bit 7. Doing that by hand
 * with `setBrightness(0)` is the trap documented on `setBrightness()`:
 * the screen goes black but the PPU keeps fetching and the write is
 * dropped. The module removes the chance to get it wrong.
 *
 * @par Example
 * @code
 * static u16 ui_map[32 * 32];
 * static Panel ui = {
 *     .map = ui_map, .vram_addr = 0x4400, .base_tile = 0,
 *     .stride = 4, .palette = 2, .priority = 1,
 * };
 *
 * panelInit(&ui);
 * panelDraw(&ui, 0, 0, 16, 3);            // a HUD, permanently
 * panelPut(&ui, 1, 1, ICON_HEART);        // an icon inside it
 * panelFlush(&ui);
 * ...
 * panelDraw(&ui, 2, 22, 28, 6);           // the dialog box, on demand
 * panelFlush(&ui);
 * ...
 * panelClear(&ui, 2, 22, 28, 6);          // and away again
 * panelFlush(&ui);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par Module
 * `panel` (depends on `dma`, `console`)
