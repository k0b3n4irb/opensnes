# lib architecture — the C / ASM split policy

Outcome of the C1 audit (2026-07, `.claude/notes/chantiers/c1_asm_audit.md`).
This is the normative answer to "should this lib code be C or 65816
assembly?" — every past decision below is benchmark-backed, and future
ones must be too.

## The policy

**Default: C.** New lib code is written in C unless it falls into one
of the three measured ASM niches below. The cc65816 toolchain earns
this default: the codegen is within ±15 % of hand ASM on
register-stuffing and pure-RAM state code (mode7's `SetScale` is
*faster* in C), the ABI lint cannot even apply to C (nothing to
verify), and every compiled function is one less bus-factor liability.

**ASM is reserved for three profiles**, each demonstrated by an audit
verdict:

1. **DB-pinned bulk-state engines** (`map.asm`): ≥ multiple KB of
   state deliberately placed in bank $7E above the C-visible WRAM
   mirror, accessed at 5-6 cycles via the data-bank register. Compiled
   C must use 4-byte far pointers (~13 cycles/access): measured
   **+33 % on the lightest possible path** before the buffer loops.
2. **Register-pinned per-frame inner loops** (`sprite_dynamic.asm`):
   functions that keep X/Y/DB pinned across dozens of accesses.
   Compiled C re-derives every array index per statement — a
   register-allocation gap, not fixable by peepholes. Measured
   **~+50 %** on the steady draw path, multiplied by sprite count per
   frame, part of it inside the NMI's VBlank budget.
3. **Upstream-parity code** (`snesmod.asm`): foreign drivers whose
   value is behavioural identity with their ecosystem. Kept on
   provenance, no benchmark needed.

## The process (non-negotiable)

- Measure with `testing/fixtures/benchrom` (frame-count brackets, empty-loop
  calibration) BEFORE and AFTER. Same harness both sides.
- Migration passes at **≤ +10 %** on the hot paths. Exceptions must be
  argued in absolute cycles on the real per-frame callers and recorded
  in the audit note (mode7's trig paths: +39 % relative but 0.36 % of
  a frame absolute — migrated by owner decision).
- On the NMI/VBlank path the rule is strict — no absolute-cost
  exceptions (the budget is ~4 KB DMA + a fixed cycle window, shared).
- A migration should pay its way in compiler improvements: mode7's
  port forced the byte-pair store fusion (~18 cycles saved on every
  16-bit MMIO write, corpus-wide) and exposed two silent-miscompilation
  bugs. If the port only fights the emitter, stop and file the emitter
  gap instead.
- Kept-ASM modules carry their invariants in the file header (DB
  discipline, register pinning, NMI budget, C-contract struct layouts)
  and stay under the ABI lint.

## Current split (post-audit)

| Module | Form | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| mode7 | **C** (migrated 2026-07-19) | register stuffing + PPU multiplier; fusion closed most of the gap |
| audio v2 | **C** + SPC700 driver from source | new engine (replaced broken-ABI audio.asm) |
| map | ASM (verdict KEEP) | profile 1 — bank-$7E bulk state |
| sprite_dynamic | ASM core + C cold paths | profile 2 — pinned-register inner loops; dispatch/helpers/meta already C |
| snesmod | ASM (verdict KEEP) | profile 3 — upstream parity (mukunda's driver) |
| everything else | C | the default |

## `const` on pointer parameters — where it belongs, and where it costs

Since #121, a dereference through a `const`-qualified pointer compiles
to a **bank-honouring far read**; a non-const one compiles to
`lda.l $0000,x` — bank $00, always. So `const` in a public signature is
not decoration, it is the switch between "works in any bank" and
"silently reads garbage outside bank $00". It is also not free.

**Const-qualify** a pointer parameter when it points at **caller-owned
read-only data that may live in ROM**: tile sheets, palettes, tilemaps,
collision maps, sample banks. Two things follow, both wanted:

- callers can keep their own arrays `const`, so *their* C indexing of
  that data is bank-safe too. Without it the SDK forces `const` off the
  user's data — `dmaCopyVram(tiles, …)` on a `static const u8 tiles[]`
  was a hard `assignment to pointer discards qualifiers` error before
  the 2026-07-21 audit;
- if the lib itself dereferences the pointer, the read becomes correct
  for far data (this is what `collideTile` needed).

**Do not const-qualify** a pointer to a **RAM struct the caller owns**
(`Rect *`, `AnimPlayer *`, `AudioVoiceState *`). C RAM is confined to
`$00:0000-$1FFF` by construction (defect B2), so the bank is *always*
$00 and the far path buys nothing while costing a lot: const-qualifying
the five `Rect *` parameters in `collision.h` grew the module's total
frame usage from 826 to 1294 bytes (+57 %) and turned each 4-instruction
field read into ~10, with `lda.w #0` literally supplying the bank. That
experiment was run and reverted on 2026-07-21; don't re-run it.

Rule of thumb: **const follows the data's storage, not its
mutability.** Read-only *and* possibly in ROM → `const`. Read-only but
necessarily in RAM → leave it alone.

## Future emitter work that could move these lines

Recorded, not scheduled: a "pinned data bank" region concept would
close map's far-access gap; cross-statement register allocation for
array indices would close sprite_dynamic's. Either landing justifies
re-running the audit for its module — benchrom keeps the baselines.
